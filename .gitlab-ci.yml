# Template for GitLab CI configuration for AgentDesign WordPress Themes/Plugins.
# (Revision 1.3)

# The standard stages for a CI/CD pipeline
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# The Docker image we use that contains our custom CI scripts
image: registry.gitlab.com/agentdesign/sysadmin/docker/docker-agentdesign-wordpress-ci

# Copy our private SSH key and known hosts keys into place for SFTP deployments
before_script:
  - set -e
  - aws s3 sync s3://agentdesign-gitlab-ci/ssh /root/.ssh && chmod 400 /root/.ssh/id_rsa


#########
# BUILD #
#########

# Build all branches using the 'build-wp-plugin' script to obtain a ZIP file
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - build-wp-plugin -v
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - wpcd-artefacts/*.zip


########
# TEST #
########

# Remove leading dot to enable test stage if/when there are plugin unit tests
# (in most cases, plugins do not have test suites)
.test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - test-wp-plugin -v

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - for file in $(find . -name "*.php"); do php -l $file; done


##########
# DEPLOY #
##########

# The 'deploy-wp-plugin' script determines the deployment to use from the 'WPCD_PLATFORM'
# environment variable. The deployment driver determines where to deploy it to from
# the 'environment.name' setting.
#

# For 'master' branch builds, put the latest copy in our S3 archive for subsequently run site builds.

# plan to commit dangerous code to develop branch. Better safe than sorry.
